# DataBase_GUI
Implement a conversion tool to go from GUI --> php code or SQL scripts. Easily create, modify, &amp; interact with database info.

Uses linked lists to avoid unecessary resource drain from additional blank columns and rows.
That should prove to shorten search, filter, and modification times for data.
Eventually will tie to web-database to pull and place data as well as create database views in php code and websites.
